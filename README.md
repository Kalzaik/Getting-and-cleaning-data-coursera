## The program will do
### 1.Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
### 2.Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
### 3.Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
### 4.Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
### 5.From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
## Programs flow
### first we load all the data to a variable
### then merge all the data
### seperate each feature from measurement
### calculate the mean for each subject and label for each feature in all measurement
